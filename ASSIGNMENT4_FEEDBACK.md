Hi Peter!

This feedback is for ASSIGNMENT 4 only. The "connect to an API" project, aka dog facts!

Obviously you've gone for a streamlined assignment here, and it works!

As you can see below you've ticked most boxes, so you have got yourself a Godkänt grade.

However, in order to get the VG you have to complete the "append arguments" and "return multiple properties" requirements.

The good news is that your api supports a "number" parameter: https://kinduff.github.io/dog-api/

So you could, as an example, ask the user for how many facts they want, or have  "1 fact" & "2 facts" buttons. Then add the selection to the API call, loop through the result and show the facts. They should be able to make a different choice each time - nothing hard coded.

It's clear you know what you are doing, but I have to be consistent in assessing the assignemnts. I have no doubt you can do this in probably less than 15 lines of code, but it's your choice.

You have a Gödkänt now, or make the above changes for a VG. Please let me know what you want to do.
